# Font Awesome demo for Business Central

This repository contains a demo that showcases how to use web fonts inside a Business
Central control add-in.

The example here is Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) but the same way you can
use any other web font.

Happy fonting!

### Update 2019-05-30

By popular demand: some folks didn't know how to get this button to emit a click event,
so this amazing feature is now fully supported. Special thanks to @eHougaard and 
@waldo1001 for pointing out how stupid it is to have a button without a click event. Guys,
enjoy clicking!

### Notes to the Reorganized-ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’© branch

This branch is created by demand of @waldo1001, he wanted to see if his extension can
handle the Control Add-in files. As it turns out, it cannot.
